# Computex

This repo now has two top-level directories:

- `computex/` — the existing Codex CLI codebase (Rust, Node, docs, scripts).
- `macos-app/` — the new macOS host app that runs the macOS VM and UI.

If you are working on the CLI, start in `computex/README.md`.
If you are working on the host app, start in `macos-app/README.md`.
